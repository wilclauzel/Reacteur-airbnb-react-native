## General info

First project of [Le Reacteur](https://www.lereacteur.io/) training on mobile application in order to put into practice our knowledge in Native React.

This project is based on a Le Reacteur training 's server application which managed offers and users authentication. This part is not included in this exercice.

This project, with a pedagogical aim, should allow us to put forward our knowledge to employers.

## Overview

This application is composed of 3 main screens :

- The first screen lists some housing offers with main characteristics (main image, notation, price).

- The second allows to consult the details of an offer (comment, location on a map, complementary images).

- The third allows you to see on a map the offers around you (near to your position) and to access to the offer detail.

- others screens manage authentication and personalization your profile (name, picture)
